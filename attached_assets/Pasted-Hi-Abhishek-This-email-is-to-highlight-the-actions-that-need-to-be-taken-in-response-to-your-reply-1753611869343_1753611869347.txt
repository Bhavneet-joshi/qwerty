Hi Abhishek,

This email is to highlight the actions that need to be taken in response to your reply to the non-compliance notice, as well as to provide initial feedback on a few of the designs shared.

Actions Required on Non-Compliance

1. Restoration of Old Designs:
The previously uploaded designs can be easily restored using GitHub version history. You are required to recover and re-upload them within 24 hours, i.e., by 10:00 PM IST, 16th July 2025.

2. Final Warning on Further Breach:
Please note that any further non-compliance will result in termination of the agreement under Clause 9.3 of the Master Service Agreement (MSA). Kindly treat this as a final notice.

3. Clarification on Agreement Review:
In your previous email, you confirmed that you have reviewed the entire agreement. However, the registration process in your designs does not align with the requirements defined in the SOW – Backend. Please provide an explanation for this inconsistency.


Feedback – Register Pages and Flow

As per Clause 3.3, Point 1 of the SOW – Backend (Authentication and Authorization – Client), the registration process must consist of four distinct steps. Your current design partially aligns with this but requires corrections as follows:

Step 1:

Should include Mobile Number, Email, and CAPTCHA (as per the clause).

Your design incorrectly includes First Name and Last Name, which are not required at this stage.

CAPTCHA is currently missing.

>>> Action: Add CAPTCHA to Step 1 and move Name fields to Step 2.


Step 2:

Should involve OTP submission, which is completely missing in your design.


>>> Action: Add OTP entry as a separate second step.

Step 3:

Should include basic details, such as:

Name
Contact information (Mobile and Email – should be prefilled)
Address (to be filled by the user)

Your current design partially includes this information, but also asks for Aadhaar and PAN, which are not required at registration.

>>> Action: Remove Aadhaar and PAN fields; ensure all other fields align.


Step 4:

Should include Password creation, with validation rules for password strength.

Your design currently presents this in Screen 3.

>>> Action: Move this to Step 4 and clearly include strength requirements.


Step 5:

Your Screen 4 confirms all entered details. This is a good addition.


> Action: Retain this screen but remove PAN and add Address in the confirmation summary.


General UI Remarks:

The overall color scheme is good.
Error messages and validations appear well-designed.

>>> I will approve the registration flow once:

The steps above are implemented properly,
Tablet view designs are shared, and
Dark mode versions are submitted.


Feedback – Contact Us Page

The overall layout is visually appropriate.

However, the actual map view is missing.


>>> Action: Add the map section to the design.


Additionally, please clarify:

Where is the message directed when a user clicks “Send Message” in the Send Us a Message section?

>>> This page will be approved once the map is added, clarification is provided, and dark mode design is also shared.

No Assumed Approval for Installment

Please note that none of the above comments or suggestions shall be considered as design approval, whether partial or basic.
Approval required for release of the 1st installment remains withheld until all conditions are fully satisfied.

Design Consistency

Please provide a brief explanation as to why the golden or goldenrod color palette (as per branding guidelines) was not used at all in your current design submissions.

Remaining Feedback

Feedback on the remaining pages will be shared shortly.
