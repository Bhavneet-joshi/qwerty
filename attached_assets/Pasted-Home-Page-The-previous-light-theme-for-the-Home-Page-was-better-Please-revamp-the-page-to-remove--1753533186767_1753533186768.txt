Home Page:
The previous light theme for the Home Page was better. Please revamp the page to remove and update the required elements, as previously guided, while retaining the theme.
For the dark theme, please apply the same alignment used in the light theme.
The design will be approved once the aforementioned issues are addressed and the updated files have been re-uploaded.
Navbar and Footer:
Navbar:
The navbar is not displaying any dropdown menus as specified in the UI section of the Statement of Work (SOW), despite the reference design being provided.
Why does the navbar include Login and Register buttons across all dashboards?
Why does the navbar not display different options before and after login?
Please redesign the navbar to incorporate a dropdown with hover effects and display different options based on the user's login type.

Footer:
Please retain the previous footer design, as the new version does not present well.
Why is the footer not included on protected pages?
Also include a site map in the footer. Instead of listing individual services, it should contain specific items, which will be shared once a few fully compliant designs are submitted.
